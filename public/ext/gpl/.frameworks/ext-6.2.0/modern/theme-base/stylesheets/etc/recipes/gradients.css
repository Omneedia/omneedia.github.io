/**
 * Adds a background gradient into a specified selector.
 *
 *     @include background-gradient(#444, 'glossy');
 *
 * You can also use color-stops if you want full control of the gradient:
 *
 *     @include background-gradient(#444, color-stops(#333, #222, #111));
 *
 * @param {Color} $bg-color
 * The base color of the gradient.
 *
 * @param {String/List} [$type=matte]
 * The style of the gradient, one of five pre-defined options: matte, bevel, glossy, recessed, or linear:
 *
 *     @include background-gradient(red, 'glossy');
 *
 * It can also accept a list of color-stop values:;
 *
 *     @include background-gradient(black, color-stops(#333, #111, #000));
 *
 * Values 'flat' and 'none' will result in no gradient, just flat background-color
 *
 * @param {String} $direction
 * The direction of the gradient.
